# Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the Imaging Data Commons!

## About IDC

The [National Cancer Institute Imaging Data Commons (IDC)](https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/) is a cloud-based repository of publicly available cancer imaging data, co-located with analysis and exploration tools. As part of the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC), IDC provides researchers with:
* Access to >85 TB of cancer imaging data, including radiology, brightfield, and fluorescence microscopy images
* Image-derived data such as annotations, segmentations, and quantitative measurements
* Accompanying clinical data
* Cloud-based infrastructure for data exploration and analysis

## Key Features

* Free and open access: No registration or access requests required
* Commercial-friendly licensing: >95% of data covered by CC-BY license
* Cloud-based: Data available from both Google and AWS public buckets
* Standardized data: All images and derived data harmonized into DICOM format
